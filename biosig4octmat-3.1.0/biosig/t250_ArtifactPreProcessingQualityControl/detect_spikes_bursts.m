% DETECT_SPIKES_BURSTS detects spikes and bursts of spikes in
% neural recordings.
% Spikes are detected when voltages increase is larger than slopeThreshold
% (default 20 V/s) within a window of length winlen (default 0.0002 s). An interspike interval
% large than dT_Burst (default 75 ms) define the start of the next burst.

%
% Input:
% 	filename: name of source file
%	chan	list of channels that should be analyzed (default is 0: all channels)
%	HDR	header structure obtained by SOPEN, SLOAD, or meXSLOAD
%	data	signal data that should be analyzed
%	slopeThreshold	[default: 10 V/s] Spike is detected when
%		slope (over time winlen) exceeds this value
%	winlen	[default: .2e-3 s] windowlength in seconds for computing slope
%	dT_Burst	[default: 50e-3 s] am inter-spike-interval (ISI) exceeding this value,
%		marks the beginning of a new burst
%               'OPTIMUM_ISI' will use the function OPTIMUM_ISI_SPIKE_BURST_SEPARATION
%               for identifying dT_Burst.
%	dT_Exclude an interspike interval smaller than this value, indicates a
%		double detection, and the second detection is deleted.
%		in case of several consecutive ISI's smaller than this value,
%		all except the first spikes are deleted.
%	'OptimumJK' overrides previously defined settings, and uses the optimal setting based on
%		an JK's data set. It sets slopeThreshold = 2.5, dT=450e-6, dT_Exclude = 2e-3;
%		These settings were found based on 18 different recordings containing
%		23999 spikes, 3967 bursts, and over 9700 seconds of recorded data.
%	outputFilename
%		name of file for storing the resulting data with the
%		detected spikes and bursts in GDF format.
%	eventFilename
%		filename to store event inforamation in GDF format. this is similar to
%		the outputFile, except that the signal data is not included and is, therefore,
%		much smaller than the outputFile
%	burstFilename
%		filename for the "burst table", containing basic properties of each burst,
%		(it is an ASCII file in <tab>-delimited format)
%
%	Arguments can appear in any order and multiple times (except for filename, chan, HDR and data),
%	In case of conflicting definitions, the latest definition has highest precedence and is used.
%
%
% Output:
%     HDR	header structure as defined in biosig
%     HDR.EVENT includes the detected spikes and bursts.
%     HDR.BurstTable contains for each burst (each in a row) the following 5 numbers:
%	channel number, sweep number, OnsetTime within sweep [s],
%	number of spikes within burst, and average inter-spike interval (ISI) [ms]
%     data	signal data, one channel per column
%		between segments, NaN values for 0.1s are introduced
